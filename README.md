Language learning software

Encourage the students to write down what they actually desire to say, like every day one or two phrases.

Let them read a book, a children book for example. But assist them as effectively as possible in beginning with this phase of learning.

Analyse the text of a book and learn during a short time (2 or 3 days):
1) 10 most frequent words of the entire book
2) 10 most frequent words of the current chapter
3) 10 most frequent words of the current paragraph
4) The words of the current line.

Repeat this process for each line, paragraph and chapter, until one has read the entire book.

Encourage the student with statistics and progress bars.

Learning process needs to be efficient and not a stupid game. The habit of learning should also lead to the effective learning of the language.
